    <p class="para"><b>Managing a hotel comes with a range of responsibilities. You must be able to adapt to new
        challenges,
        help different departments and ensure the hotel maintains a standard of excellence. As a hotel
        manager, you will be responsible for overseeing and having a strong knowledge of finance, planning,
        service and organization. While you have a team of managers working alongside you, as hotel manager
        you have to lead rather than follow. You must also make sure your staff are managing their time and
        departments efficiently, whether that be through improving their monthly profits or simply ensuring
        a guest’s expectations are exceeded.

        You must have strong attention to detail, leadership and teamwork skills. At some hotels, depending
        on the size and type, you may find yourself dealing with a lot more day-to-day tasks than you would
        at a more prestigious place. You may also have less contact with guests, but you’ll spend time
        monitoring the business through regular meetings.Managing a hotel comes with a range of
